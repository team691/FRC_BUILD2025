Our Project691 code for the 2024-2025 season, ReefScape.
Second year implementing SwerveDrive into our codebase, and first year using pathplanner for autonomous.

**Implemented**:
- SwerveDrive with hitchbacks in case something goes wrong + proper power allocation
- Used a HolonmicPathController for pathplanner during inital phase of autonomous
- Created subsystems for a timed shooter mechanism with sonar sensor (did not use an elevator system)
- Made a functional climber mechnaims for deepcage climb

**Things to work on**:
  - Continue work on simulator, get that setup for next season
  - Setup robot pose for autonomous functions during teleop
  - Create a vision system during teleop to drive towards different apriltags and score automatically, minimize human involvement
